## IOI 2025 Syllabus

The official IOI Syllabus is a document that evolves over time. The version applicable for IOI 2025 was finalized at the end of IOI 2024. It serves as a guideline for contestants, team leaders, and problem creators.

The syllabus is divided into several topic areas, with each topic classified into one of the following categories:
*   **Included, unlimited:** Fair game for tasks.
*   **Included, to be defined:** May appear, but with constraints.
*   **Included, not for task description:** Can be used, but won't be the main focus.
*   **Outside of focus:** Not expected to be required.
*   **Excluded, but open to discussion:** Not included, but might be in the future.
*   **Explicitly excluded:** Not allowed.

### Key Subject Areas:

#### **1. Mathematics**

*   **Arithmetics and Geometry:**
    *   Integers, modular arithmetic, number theory (primes, GCD).
    *   Geometry in 2D (points, lines, polygons).
*   **Discrete Structures (DS):**
    *   **DS1: Functions, relations, and sets:** Basic concepts.
    *   **DS2: Basic logic:** Propositional logic.
    *   **DS3: Proof techniques:** Direct proofs, proof by contradiction, induction.
    *   **DS4: Basics of counting:** The inclusion-exclusion principle, pigeonhole principle, permutations and combinations, binomial coefficients.
    *   **DS5: Graphs and trees:** Undirected and directed graphs, trees, connectivity, traversals.
    *   **DS6: Discrete probability:** Basic concepts.

#### **2. Computing Science**

*   **Programming Fundamentals (PF):**
    *   **PF1: Fundamental programming constructs:** Variables, control structures, functions.
    *   **PF2: Algorithms and problem-solving:** Algorithmic design, implementation strategies.
    *   **PF3: Fundamental data structures:** Arrays, records, strings, stacks, queues, linked lists, binary trees.
    *   **PF4: Recursion:** Concept and implementation of recursion.
    *   **PF5: Event-driven programming:** Basic concepts.

*   **Algorithms and Complexity (AL):**
    *   **AL1: Basic algorithmic analysis:** Big O notation, complexity classes (P, NP).
    *   **AL2: Algorithmic strategies:** Brute-force, greedy, divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming.
    *   **AL3: Algorithms and data structures:**
        *   Sorting and searching algorithms.
        *   Data structures: Heaps, graphs, binary search trees (including balanced variants), segment trees, Fenwick trees, tries.
        *   Graph algorithms: Shortest paths (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall), MST (Kruskal, Prim), topological sorting.
        *   String algorithms: Hashing, KMP, Z-algorithm.
    *   **AL4: Distributed algorithms:** Basic concepts.
    *   **AL5: Basic computability:** The halting problem.
    *   **AL6: Automata and grammars:** Finite-state machines, context-free grammars.
    *   **AL7: Advanced algorithmic analysis:** Amortized analysis.
    *   **AL8: Cryptographic algorithms:** Basic concepts.
    *   **AL9: Geometric algorithms:** Convex hull, sweep-line.
    *   **AL10: Parallel algorithms:** Basic concepts.

## IOI 2026 Syllabus

The IOI 2026 will be held in Uzbekistan. As of now, there is no separate syllabus specifically released for IOI 2026. The standard practice is that the **most recently approved official IOI syllabus will be used**.

Therefore, the **IOI 2025 syllabus is the guiding document for IOI 2026 preparation**, unless a new version is developed and approved by the IOI community in the interim. Contestants preparing for IOI 2026 should follow the IOI 2025 syllabus as their primary reference.

For the most current and detailed information, always refer to the official IOI website: [ioinformatics.org](https://ioinformatics.org/).
