- Step 01: define and figure out the problem i want to solve
	- And the steps/ideas/concepts i need to take to solve it
- Step 02: how am i going to solve it

	- Various studies have shown that on complex software systems, only 10-40% of a programmer’s time is actually spent writing the initial program. The other 60-90% is spent on maintenance, which can consist of **debugging** (removing bugs), updates to cope with changes in the environment (e.g. to run on a new OS version), enhancements (minor changes to improve usability or capability), or internal improvements (to increase reliability or maintainability)
	- Consequently, it’s worth your time to spend a little extra time up front (before you start coding) thinking about the best way to tackle a problem, what assumptions you are making, and how you might plan for the future, in order to save yourself a lot of time and trouble down the road.
- Step 03: write the program
	- knowledge of a programming language: `C++`
	- text editor: to save/edit code

> [!tip]
> Name the first/primary source code file in each program `main.cpp`. This makes it easy to determine which source code file is the primary one.
- Step 04: compiling source code
